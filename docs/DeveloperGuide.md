### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Handles reading and writing data to the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components will:

* Define its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implement its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. 
Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class.
This is to prevent the outside component being coupled to the implementation of a component, as illustrated in the partial class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g.,`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. 
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are present in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. 
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/logic/Logic.java)

Below is a partial class diagram of the `Logic` component.

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SoConnectParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), 
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SoConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SoConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, etc.) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible, e.g., during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component does the following:

* Stores the SoConnect data, i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', 
e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SoConnect`, which `Person` references. This allows `SoConnect` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. <br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component does the following:
* Saves both SoConnect data and user preference data in `json` format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `SoConnectStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only one of the functionality is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Autocomplete component
**API** : [`Autocomplete.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/autocomplete/Autocomplete.java)

**TODO: Add AutocompleteClassDiagram**

The `Autocomplete` component does the following:
* Stores the unique names in SoConnect.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Autocomplete` component gets a list of unique names from the objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `soconnect.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting feature

#### Implementation

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`.
Additionally, the mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniquePersonList`:

* `UniquePersonList#sortByName(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the contact list by **Name** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByPhone(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the contact list by **Phone** number in increasing order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByEmail(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the contact list by **Email** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByAddress(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the contact list by **Address** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByTag(Tag tag, Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the contact list by a specified **Tag**.

These operations sort in reverse order when `isReverse` is true.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `sort t/!friend n/` command to perform a multi-level sort. `SortCommandParser` checks the user input to confirm
that the parameters have been entered. `SortCommandParser` calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `t/!friend` and `n/`.

Step 2. Each parameter is processed by `SortCommandParser#convertArguments`. The `friend` string is checked to see if it 
fulfils the requirements of the `Tag` class. If the user entered string values for non-`Tag` parameters,
they are ignored and the command continues execution as per normal.

Step 3. The `sort` command sorts the currently displayed list by **Name** first, calling `Model#sortByName(Boolean isReverse)` where `isReverse = false`.

Step 4. The `sort` command sorts the currently displayed list by the `friend` **Tag** next, calling `Model#sortByTag(Tag tag, Boolean isReverse)` where `isReverse = true`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

(insert sequence diagram here)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The user is shown the sorted list. The sorted list contains the same contacts as the previous displayed list. It has two sections, the first section contains contacts without the `friend` tag and the second section contains contacts with the `friend` tag. Each section is sorted by name in alphabetical order.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command:

(insert activity diagram here)

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement multi-level sorting:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the list once for each parameter entered by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to sort.

* **Alternative 2:** Single complex sorting method that combines all the individual sorting for each parameter.
    * Pros: Save time as only 1 sorting operation is carried out.
    * Cons: Harder to modify when more parameters are added. Can result in more bugs due to complexity.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Search feature

#### Implementation

The search mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommand` and `SearchCommandParser`.

This feature allows user to customise the contacts displayed based on the information provided. For example, user can decide to have specific search result that satisfies all the conditions or to have more generic result that only satisfies one of the conditions.

It implements the following main operations:

* `SearchCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates _filtered_ person list to contain contacts that match the search query.
* `SearchCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses search query based on the condition and information specified.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `search n/John a/NUS` command to perform a joint search. `SearchCommandParser` calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to group the search parameters according to the prefix `/n` and `/a`.

Step 2. The `search` command search the SoConnect by matching the search parameters and condition with the available contact information, calling `StringUtil#containsKeywordsIgnoreCase(String sentence, String keywords)`.

Step 3. The `search` command then updates _filtered_ person list to contains the matching contacts. If no matching contact is found,
 the `search` command will call `StringUtil#containsSomeKeywordsIgnoreCase(String sentence, String keywords)` to search for contacts that match partially to the search parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

(insert sequence diagram here)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SearchCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 4. The user is shown the _filtered_ list. The _filtered_ list contains all contacts that are relevant to the user's search query.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a search command:

(insert activity diagram here)

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement searching:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search the list once for each parameter entered by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to search.

* **Alternative 2:** Single complex searching method that combines all the individual searching for each parameter.
    * Pros: Save time as only 1 search operation is carried out.
    * Cons: Harder to modify when more parameters are added. Can result in more bugs due to complexity.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSoConnect`. It extends `SoConnect` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `SoConnectStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSoConnect#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedSoConnect#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedSoConnect#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSoConnect()`, `Model#undoSoConnect()` and `Model#redoSoConnect()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSoConnect` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSoConnect()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SoConnectStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSoConnect()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `SoConnectStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSoConnect()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `SoConnectStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSoConnect()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SoConnect state, then there are no previous SoConnect states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSoConnect()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSoConnect()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `SoConnectStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone SoConnect states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSoConnect()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSoConnect()`, `Model#undoSoConnect()` or `Model#redoSoConnect()`. Thus, the `SoConnectStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSoConnect()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `SoConnectStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Tag adding feature

#### Implementation

The tag adding mechanism is facilitated by `TagAddCommand` and `TagAddCommandParser`.
Additionally, The mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniqueTagList` and `UniquePersonList`.

* `UniqueTagList#hasTag(Tag tag)` - Checks if the tagList has the tag.
* `UniquePersonList#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` - Sets the same person with the new tag.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `tag add 1 t/friend` command to add the tag, `friend`, to the person indicated by the `INDEX`, 1.
`TagAddCommandParser` calls  `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `1` and `t/friend`.

Step 2. The `tag add` command collects the list of persons shown, containing them in `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

Step 3. The `tag add` command checks if the index is valid, calling `Index#getZeroBased()`.

Step 4. The `tag add` command receives the person indicated by the index, containing it in `List#get(int index)`.

Step 5. The `tag add` command creates the same person with the new tag included, containing it in `TagAddCommand#createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit, Tag tag)`.

Step 6. The `tag add` command replaces the old person with the new, updated person, calling `Model#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a tag add command:

(insert activity diagram here)

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement tag add:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new person with the tag included.
    * Pros: Prevents direct access into the tags of a person.
    * Cons: Potential error occurs if some form of duplication is allowed.

* **Alternative 2:** Directly add the tag into the person .
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Easy to access into the tags of a person. Could cause accidental bugs.

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Tag editing feature

The tag adding mechanism is facilitated by `TagEditCommand` and `TagEditCommandParser`.
Additionally, The mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniqueTagList`, `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTodoList`.

* `UniqueTagList#editTag(Tag oldTag, Tag newTag)` - Changes the old tag with the new tag.
* `UniquePersonList#changeRelevantPersonTag(oldTag, newTag)` - Updates every person who has the old tag with the new tag.
* `UniqueTodoList#changeRelevantTodoTag(Tag oldTag, Tag newTag)` -  Updates every task which has the old tag with the new tag.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag editing mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `tag edit t/friend t/bestFriend` command to edit the old tag, `friend`, to the new tag, `bestFriend`.
`TageditCommandParser` calls  `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `t/friend` and `t/bestFriend`.

Step 2. The `tag edit` command edits the old tag with the new tag, calling `Model#editTag(oldTag, newTag)`.

Step 3. The old tag on every person and every task is now replaced with the new tag for display.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a tag add command:

(insert activity diagram here)

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement tag edit:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new tag and replaces the old tag with the new one.
    * Pros: Prevents direct access into the information of a tag.
    * Cons: Tedious. Necessary to manually change the old tag in every person and every task.

* **Alternative 2:** Change the tag's name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Can potentially introduce bugs due to direct access into the tag's implementation.

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Customise Order Feature

#### Implementation

This feature is mainly implemented by the `CustomiseOrderCommand` and `PersonCard` classes. The following methods are the main ones:

* `CustomiseOrderCommand#execute()` - saves the new attribute order in the `preferences.json` file by calling `Model#setGuiSettings()`.
* `PersonCard#setAttributes()` - reads the order from the `preferences.json` file and builds the `PersonCard` in the order specified.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this feature behaves at each part of the mechanism.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user sees a list of contacts, each contact contains a name, a phone number, an email, an address and possibly some tags. Under each contacts' name, the current order the user sees is: `TAGS`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS` (this is also the default order).

Note:

* The name will always be at the top of each contact as it is the most crucial information of each contact.

Step 2. The user executes `customise order e/` as the user wants the emails appear right below the name.

* Step 2a. `SoConnectParaser` processes the input and calls the parser `CustomiseCommandParser` to parse `" order e/"`.
* Step 2b. `CustomiseCommandParser` processes the input and calls the parser `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` to parse `" e/"`.
* Step 2c. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` processes the input into a list of attributes. In this case, the list of attributes only contains `EMAIL` and is missing the attributes `TAGS`, `PHONE` and `ADDRESS`. The missing attributes are added to the list according to the default order mentioned above. The list of attributes now contains `EMAIL`, `TAGS`, `PHONE` and `ADDRESS`.
* Step 2d. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` creates a `CustomiseOrderCommand` with the list of attributes.
* Step 2e. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` returns the `CustomiseOrderCommand`.
* Step 2f. `Logic` executes the `CustomiseOrderCommand`.
* Step 2g. `CustomiseOrderCommand#execute()` calls `Model#setGuiSettings()` to save the new attribute order in `preferences.json`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates Steps 2a to 2g:

![CustomiseOrderSequenceDiagram](images/CustomiseOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

Note:

* The lifeline for `CustomiseOrderCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Step 3. The user sees the new ordering after `PersonCard#setAttributes()` sets the attributes based of the new order in `preferences.json`.

Note:

* If the user closes the application and relaunches the application, the attributes are still in the same order that the user set previously.

#### Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sets the order by using 4 placeholder JavaFX `FlowPane`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Hard to maintain if different styling required for different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** Have 24 different FXML files and use the one that is in the required order.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Harder to maintain and make changes.
