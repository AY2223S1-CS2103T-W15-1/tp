### Project: SoConnect

SoConnect is a desktop app for NUS SoC students to manage their contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=chongcheekaiclarence&breakdown=true)
* **Enhancements implemented**:
* **Tag Create Feature**: Added the ability to create a tag to the Tag List.
  * What it does: allows the user to create a tag in the tagList so it can be used to tag contacts and todos.
  * Justification: This feature allows categorisation of contacts and tasks, so it is easier to search for things related to the tag.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Tag Add Feature**: Added the ability to add a tag to a contact.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a tag to a contact.
  * Justification: This feature allows linking between the tag and the contact.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Tag Edit Feature**: Added the ability to edit a tag.
  * What it does: allows the user to edit a tag in the tagList so that we can change the tag in the contacts.
  * Justification: This feature allows tag-naming mistakes to be fixed.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Tag Remove Feature**: Added the ability to remove a tag from a contact.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove a tag from a contact.
  * Justification: This feature allows de-linking of a tag from a contact.
  * Highlights: Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Tag Delete Feature**: Added the ability to delete a tag.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete a tag from the Tag List.
  * Justification: This feature allows removal of the tag to prevent accidental access of unused tags.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Contributions to documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `tag create`, `tag edit`, `tag add`, `tag remove` and `tag delete`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added documentation of implementation of `tag add` and `tag edit` features.
    * Added UML diagram for `tag add` and `tag edit` features.
* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  * In charge of integration.
  * Set up Github project board.
* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  * Link to PRs reviewed: [PRs reviewed link](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+reviewed-by%3AChongCheeKaiClarence)
* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
